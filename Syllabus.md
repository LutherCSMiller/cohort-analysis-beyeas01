    Office Hours:  TBD

## Goals

The goals for this course are to begin to integrate many of the skills you have learned in the prerequisite courses.  And to deepen your knowledge in several other areas. Specifically:

* To become a skeptical consumer of data, statistics, and visualizations
* Develop an understanding of what makes a good Visualization
* To practice making and presenting several different kinds of data visualizations
* To become a competent "data munger"
* To explore several of the tools commonly used in exploratory data analysis:

  * Jupyter Notebooks and friends such as Pandas, Bokeh, Altair and other
  * Tableau
  * R Studio

* To put into practice some "statistics for hackers" techniques for validating claims that people make about their data.

## Books

We will use two books for this course, neither are traditional textbooks, but both provide some structure and a lot of good information.  We will also be making use of a lot of web resources.

* *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* by Tufte
* *Data visualization with Python and Javascript* by Kyran Dale

## Topics

### Being critical of what we find published

We will spend some time reading Tufte, and putting his principles to work as we critique graphics that we find in the news and on the web.

### Gathering Data from many Sources

We'll begin to recreate some of Tufte's good examples by gathering data from the web, using the `requests`, `scrapy`, and `BeautifulSoup` modules to download, scrape, and traverse data.  

Alumni working in the data science field have told me that combining data from multiple sources is an important skill, so we will also review some SQL and look at storing and combining scraped data with structured data.

### Cleaning the Data

One of the most mundane, yet important aspects of getting real data from the web is that it is not perfect.  It contains errors and other crap that we don't want.  Python is an excellent language for doing "data munging"  Writing programs to clean data is an exercise in reducing menial repetitive work for ourselves.  This is a different mindset than writing a program that will be used by others.  This is also a good example of the principle of repeatability.  And a good example of why Jupyter notebooks are so useful.

### Exploring and Transforming the Data

There are many good tools for exploring, visualizing and transforming data.  The two biggest names in the data science world at the moment are R and Python.  In particular the Pandas package of Python.  We'll get a little practice with both of these tools.

### Presenting your Data

Being a good "data storyteller" is one of the most important skills for any data scientist.  So we'll look at a number of different ways to present our findings.  Verbally, Written, and in graphical form.
