# Data Analysis and Visualization

Course Materials for DS-320 at Luther College

## Schedule

### September 8

**Topic**

Our task for today is to Create one or more visualizations to help us put into perspective the change in
gasoline prices over the years.  We will want to follow Tufte's rule for looking at prices by computing our own
adjustment for inflation.  To do this we will begin to dive into some tools for obtaining data such as the requests module and BeautifulSoup.

* requests - for downloading web pages
* BeautifulSoup for parsing and querying web pages
* Lets look at http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb0524  as an example to get some practice.
* We may have many different data sets since I asked you to look.  One of our tasks will be to compare.
